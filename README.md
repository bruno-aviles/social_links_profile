## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Constructing the social links profile project provided an opportunity to learn and research the implementation of the CSS '@font-face' rule, as well as revisiting the application of CSS transitions.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@font-face{
    font-family: "Inter-Regular";
    font-style: normal;
    font-display: swap;
    src: 
        url(../assets/fonts/static/Inter-Regular.ttf) format(truetype);
}

.profile__link{
    transition-timing-function: ease-in;
    transition-duration: .25s;
}
```

### Continued development

 I aim to refine my ability to enhance web typography effectively and creatively by delving deeper into the font-face rule on its nuances and best practices.
